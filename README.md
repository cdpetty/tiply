# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tiply** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Clayton Petty**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total (not in one sitting)

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Added sliders for easy selecting of tip amount
- [X] Ability to change upper and lower bound of the possible tip

## Notes

One of the biggest challenges was getting the navigation to work from the main page to the settings page although after I found my mistake it wasn't too hard to fix. The other tough part was designing a page that would look good on multiple iPhone sizes. Currently this only works on the iPhone 5/5s size.
